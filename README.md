Jonathan added the function that the Game Window automatically adjusts to the screen size. 
The Game Window is now placed in the middle of the screen.

Jonathan added a free Tileset with 16x16 Tiles and designed the Arena with a different size.

When running the test file there should be a result printed in the command line which shows the success or failure
of the test.
This is supposed to happen:

When running the test, there was no message, so the AI test didn't really work.

# AI Flake8 Correction
Chatgpt was able to fix a file with 19 Flake8 Errors.
